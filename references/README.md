# Reference Scripts

This package contains Python scripts that were copied from external sources or previous projects. These scripts are not actively used in the current project but are retained for reference purposes.

## Purpose
- **Historical Reference**: These files may provide insight into older implementations or external code examples.
- **Documentation**: They might include useful documentation or implementation details that can be revisited if needed.

## Usage
- **Do Not Import**: The `__init__.py` script in this package prevents importing these scripts into the project. If you need to use a specific script, manually copy it to another package or directory.
- **Reference Only**: Use these scripts as a reference or learning resource, but avoid integrating them into the active codebase.

## Notes
- Scripts in this package might not adhere to the project's coding standards or best practices.
- Some scripts might depend on outdated libraries or environments.
