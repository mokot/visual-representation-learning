\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this study, we explored the use of Gaussian splats for autoencoding 2D images with a ResNet-based architecture. While we showed that Gaussian splats are capable of reconstructing images with a high fidelity, all autoencoder variants we tested struggled to accurately reconstruct images, capturing only limited relationships, primarily in terms of rotations and color distributions. The results revealed significant challenges in balancing reconstruction quality and compression efficiency. Future work is needed to refine the architecture, enhance the modelâ€™s ability to learn structural features, and improve overall representation accuracy.
