\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this study, we explored the use of Gaussian splats for autoencoding 2D images, leveraging a ResNet-based architecture. While our approach demonstrated promising results in terms of reconstruction quality, it highlighted the trade-off between image quality and compression efficiency. We also identified several areas for future research, including refining model architecture, improving compression methods, and exploring generative applications. Overall, our work opens up exciting possibilities for further advancements in image representation and compression techniques.
